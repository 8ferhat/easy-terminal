# Terminal Customization Guide

This repository provides a set of aliases, functions, and configurations to enhance your terminal experience. By applying these settings, you'll streamline common tasks, improve Git integration, and optimize your overall workflow.

## Features

### 1. **Aliases for Common Commands**
Aliases shorten commonly used commands to save time and improve efficiency.

```bash
alias ll='ls -lAh'      # Long listing with human-readable file sizes
alias la='ls -A'        # List all files except . and ..
alias l='ls -lh'        # List files with human-readable sizes
alias ..='cd ..'        # Shortcut to navigate up one directory
alias ...='cd ../..'    # Shortcut to navigate up two directories
alias h='history'       # Easy way to access history
```

### 2. **Git Integration in the Prompt**
Show the current Git branch directly in your prompt for easy Git workflow management.

```bash
parse_git_branch() {
    git branch 2>/dev/null | sed -n '/\*/s/\* \(.*\)/ (\1)/p'
}
export PS1='[\u@\h \W$(parse_git_branch)]\$ '  # User@host current_directory (git_branch)
```

This will display something like:

```
user@hostname current_folder (master)$
```

### 3. **History Management**
Control how your terminal history behaves for better usability.

```bash
export HISTCONTROL=ignoredups:ignorespace   # Ignore duplicate commands and commands starting with a space
export HISTSIZE=10000                        # Store 10,000 commands in memory
export HISTFILESIZE=10000                    # Store 10,000 commands in the history file
shopt -s histappend                         # Append to the history file instead of overwriting
```

### 4. **Add Custom Directories to `$PATH`**
Automatically add custom directories to your system's `$PATH`.

```bash
export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH
```

This allows you to run executable scripts from `$HOME/bin` globally.

### 5. **Terminal Behavior Enhancements**
Make your terminal window behave better when resized.

```bash
shopt -s checkwinsize   # Automatically adjust the window size after each command
```

### 6. **Custom Functions**
Some useful functions to make your terminal experience smoother:

- **Create and `cd` into a directory**:
  ```bash
  mkcd() { mkdir -p "$1" && cd "$1"; }
  ```

- **Show basic system information**:
  ```bash
  sysinfo() { 
    echo "System Information:"; 
    uname -a; 
    echo "Memory Usage:"; 
    free -h; 
  }
  ```

- **Quick Git status**:
  ```bash
  git_status() { git status --short --branch; }
  ```

### 7. **Add `fastfetch` to Your Terminal**
`fastfetch` is a command that gives you a clean system information display when opening your terminal.

```bash
fastfetch
```

#### Installation Instructions

- **For Ubuntu/Debian-based distros**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install fastfetch
  ```

- **For Arch/Arch-based distros**:
  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S fastfetch
  ```

- **For Fedora**:
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install fastfetch
  ```

### 8. **A More Convenient Terminal Experience**
For a less complicated terminal experience, copy the contents of this configuration into your `.bashrc` file (usually located at `/home/user/.bashrc`).

---

## Installation

To apply the configurations to your terminal, follow these steps:

1. Copy the contents of this file.
2. Open your `.bashrc` file (typically located at `~/.bashrc`).
3. Paste the copied content at the end of the `.bashrc` file.
4. Run `source ~/.bashrc` to apply the changes immediately.

Enjoy your more efficient terminal experience!
